# React 62 – useEffect basic exercise ⚛️

🎯 **Goal**
Understand the difference between:
- component re-render
- useEffect execution

🧠 **How it works**
- Component re-renders on **any state change**
- `useEffect` runs **only when `count` changes**

🧪 **Try this**
1. Click the button → render + effect
2. Type in the input → render only
3. Watch the console carefully

✅ If the effect does NOT run when typing → you understood it.
